<!--apparently the github README.md file allows certain whitelisted html tags. This is a test-->
<p><strong>Started on 26SEP2024</strong></p>
<p><em>This is a project demonstrating html usage on webpages.</em></p>
<p>Initial thoughts....I have learned about the boilerplate, which is essentially the structure of a html page. I learned how to piece together tags and have them show up somewhat decently (apparently CSS will pretty things up).</p> 
<p>These are the things I've learned in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
    <li>p. Allows a space to appear between text.</li>
    <li>strong. Bolds the text.</li>
    <li>em. Italicizes the text/adds emphasis.</li>
    <li>a. Adds a link to a Absolute or Relative website/webpage. Needs to utilize href="" to point to where the user is going. If I remember correctly, some security minded things to add were "noopener" and something else about no tracking? <!-- I will have to figure out those two attributes again --></li>
    <li>img. Embeds a JPG, PNG, GIF to your page. src="" needs to be added to link to the location of the picture. Make sure to add net= for screen readers to know what the picture is!</li>
    <li>h1-h6. Allows text to be larger or smaller. Usually used for titles or paragraph headlines.</li>
    <li>ul. How I made this list.</li>
    <li>ol. Step by step list.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure I forgot some tags, but that's fine for me. Well, heres to hoping I can put these things together and knock out this project without too much struggle.</p>
<p>Finished html project on 26SEP2024.</p>
<p>I felt like I did pretty good on this project! I messed up a tag with net= instead of alt= . <em>Not sure how I did that.</em> Looking at other peoples finished projects was really neat. Some people added a "back" button link to get back to the index page. Some added in the attribute to open <del>things</del> pages in new tabs. Overall, very satisifed with the project and looking forward to CSS!
