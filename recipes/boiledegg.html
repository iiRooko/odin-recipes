        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Use this recipe for perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. By adding a little vinegar and salt, the eggshell peels off so easily without tearing or sticking. I have been making them this way for years!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>6 cups waters</li>
            <li>8 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine salt, vinegar, and water in a large pot, and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Add eggs one at a time, being careful not to crack them. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil, and cook for 14 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once eggs have cooked, remove them from the hot water, and place into a container of ice water or cold, running water. Cool completely, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
